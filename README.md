# Cluster_Detection1

(1) Ensured that duplicate latitude, longitude and timestamps are not appended.

(2) When the cluster is detected, create a JSON that contains vehicle_id, the centroid of the latitudinal and longitudinal positions recorded while detecting the cluster, and the timestamp at which the cluster was detected. (For finding centroid just calculated the mean of the coordinates)
